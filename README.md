## Functions

The CarbonX project aims to provide the following key functions:

1. **Credible Trading:** The platform ensures the credibility of carbon credit trading between companies by leveraging blockchain technology. The decentralized nature of the blockchain ensures transparency and prevents dishonest dealings.

2. **Immutability:** Carbon emission records are recorded and stored on a blockchain, ensuring their immutability. This ensures the integrity and reliability of the carbon emission data, making it tamper-resistant.

3. **Verification and Audit:** The system enables storage and audit of carbon emission records, allowing companies and regulators to validate emissions data easily. This promotes accountability and trust in the carbon credit ecosystem.
